#
# Macro that checks for C++11 support and sets compiler flags
# If C++11 is not present 
#
# Macro:
#   CheckCXX11(MESSAGE_SEVERITY)
#       MESSAGE_SEVERITY        it's not mandatory and has default value of "STATUS"
#                               this is severity of message if no C++11 was found
#
# Output variables:
#   COMPILER_SUPPORTS_CXX11     compiler supports `-std=c++11` flag
#   COMPILER_SUPPORTS_CXX0X     compiler supports `-std=c++0x` flag
